# alphaordinal
A very silly technique for comparing numbers.

## What is alphaordinal?
Alphaordinal implements a method of comparing two numbers; not by their numerical values of course, but by the alphabetical order of how they are spelled.

Here's an example of the numbers 0-9 sorted in alphaordinal order.

* 8 (eight)
* 5 (five)
* 4 (four)
* 9 (nine)
* 1 (one)
* 7 (seven)
* 6 (six)
* 3 (three)
* 2 (two)
* 0 (zero)

## What practical uses does this thing have?
None
